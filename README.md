**Works on a conda virtual enviroment**

`conda create -n tensorfl python=3.6`

**To activate and deactivate the enviroment**

`conda activate tensorfl`

`conda deactivate`

Currently it doesn't seem to work with powershell or git bash. Only the windows command prompt can activate the enviroment. Even after running `conda init` it doesn't work.
