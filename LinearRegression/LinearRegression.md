# Linear Regression

[UCI Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

Linear Regression tries to find the best fit line for some data set. A line that represents all of the points of a data set.
Linear Regression is used when there is strong correlation between some data points.

$$
y = mx + b
$$

A equation with slope and offset from the origin. It's basically how can we fit a straight line through our data set.
With more than two variable we have a multidimnesional space. It works basically the same with *fancy* math.

The important steps for linear regression:
* load the dataset
* split the dataset into training data and test data
* create the model and fit it to the training data
* make predictions and test the accuracy
* change the variables for better results
